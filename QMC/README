This directory is a test of Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithms, such as those '
described by:
    http://www.huy-nguyen.com/wp-content/uploads/QMC-papers/Anderson-JChemPhys-1975.pdf
    http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~wetzel/qmc2006/KOSZ96.pdf

To compile this code, the easiest / best command is:
    g++ -std=c++11 -fopenmp -O2 -march=native Anderson.cpp

The file executes a 6-d random walk of "psips" in order to recreate the 
probability density of particles in a quantum state.

The data is output into two files: out.dat and energy.dat. These files hold
"psip" information and energy information, respectively. These have been plot
with gnuplot by simply selecting the apropriate rows or using the Anderson.gp
file as such:

    gnuplot Anserson.gp -

Feel free to look at any of these for reference!
