GENETIC VORTEX PROJECT

This is a superfluid vortex locator using genetic algorithms

The idea here is that we use a genetic algorithm to find areas where 
circulation is quantized. We basically draw circles and move them around 
until the velocity vectors add up to 0.

This is done in julia, and is run with:
    julia genetic.jl
