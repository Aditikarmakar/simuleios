This code intends to find the shortest path to a goal with some sort of 
ant-like algorithm. The idea is that ants find the shortest path by step
following pheremone trails and step counting. That's precisely what we are going
to do!

Each ant has a probability of random walks and following a pre-set trail.

compiled with: g++ ant.cpp -std=c++11
