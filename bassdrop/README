When I was younger, I was an awful fisherboy. I mean, I was really, really bad.
I would often go fishing with my father and watch as he caught fish after fish, 
while I failed to catch even one. There was, however, one fateful day where I
managed to catch a bass. I unhooked it's jaw, and held it by the mouth-gill 
area, like I was supposed to; however, my little boy hands were not able to hold
the fish for long, and I accidentally dropped it from the boat. 

I seemed to see the fish fall in slow motion, it was as if some deity from the
heavens above wanted to cherish every drop of my remorse. I vowed that day to
determine how long it actually took the fish to splash back into the water and
saunter-swim away...

Of course, this is quite an easy problem to solve. Heck, it takes two lines to 
solve with basic algebra; however, I want to solve it with code. Not just any
type of code either. Oh, no! For this, we will use one of the most useful
computational tools in any programmer's arsenal:
    Force Integration

*Insert dramatic music here*

Details:
    We are dropping a ball -- err, bass from a set height the formula is:
        x = x_0 + v_0 * t - 0.5 * 9.81 * t * t;

    That's all you need to know for now. Do whatever you like with that 
    information. There are many ways to integrate forces, and we will show at 
    least one, if not more!
