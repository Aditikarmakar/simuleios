This simulation is of Molecular Dynamics of gas particles in a box. Eventually,
We may even figure out some stuff about Pressure! For more information about 
MD code, feel free to check out the following link:

This simulation will be event-driven, which means that we will take all events
into account before actually performing the simulation.

Data in the following format:

    PID, t, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz
