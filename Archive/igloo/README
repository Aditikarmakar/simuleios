Avalanches and igloos: How to choose survivors.

The premise of this code is simple: Imagine you are in some arctic area of 
the world, with beautiful white snow and tall icy mountains looming overhead. 
You live in a small village with a single cement igloo, but plenty of small 
wooden shacks. One day, you hear a rumbling from the top of an icy mountain, 
it's an avalanche! You and the rest of the town gather to optimally fill the 
cement igloo. But how do you do that? Well, this code is meant for just that 
purpose. woo! 

So, in the off chance that you find yourself in an arctic town with a single
cement igloo under the threat of an avalanche, be sure to keep it in mind!

Implementation:
In the c++ directory (with other directories potentially coming soon), we need
to learn how to do a few things:
    1. Integrate the area of a half-sphere (igloo)
    2. Figure out how tall everyone in the town is
    3. Figure out where to place everyone
In and of themselves, none of these questions should pose a problem; however, 
this is a good example of how different coding logic is when compared to the
logic we use every day. 

Notes:
Please think about this problem on your own before checking it out here! There
is no point in this excersize if it doesn't get you to think!

The formula for a sphere is x*x + y*y + z*z = 1

Toodles!
