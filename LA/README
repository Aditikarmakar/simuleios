Linear algebra is interesting. Especially in terms of computational processing 
of matrices. See. When it comes to quantum-y simulations, linear algebra is 
absolutely 100% necessary. That said, it would be nice to take a day to review
a few aspects of linear algebra... and that's precisely what we are doign today!

So, sit back, relax... and enjoy the ride. Nothing fancy today... but there 
might be something tomorrow! ;)
